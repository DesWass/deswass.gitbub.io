### Do I need to authenticate when I login to my laptop or computer or phone?
No, the authentication only applies to Microsoft 365 applications either installed on your devices including phone or when accessing via a web browser.

### What if I don’t have my mobile device when I need to login?
You will need your mobile to log in. Due to our security requirements, multi-factor authentication cannot be bypassed or turned-off for any reason. 

### What if I don’t want the authenticator application installed on my personal device?
You will not be able to access the Microsoft 365 applications on your mobile device and will not be able to access your work account at all.

### What if I am getting prompts on my mobile about MFA and I have no where to enter the code?
Contact IT immediately. Someone else may be trying to access your account.

### What if I lose my phone or if I get a new one?
You will need to set up MFA on the new device. MFA settings cannot be transferred to your new phone.

### Do I have to use the Microsoft Authenticator app?
Technically, no. However, if your account is transitioned from standard passwords and MFA across to a passwordless configuration, you will need the Microsoft Authenticator app. In this case, it may be simpler to use the Microsoft Authenticator app from the outset.
